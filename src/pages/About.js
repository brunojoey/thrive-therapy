                <h2>Brittany Zobl | Patient Care Coordinator</h2>
                <p>
                  Brittany joins Thrive with years of experience and education in the medical
                  industry. She has lived in Sumner county for over 20 years and can't see herself
                  anywhere else. Building relationships with families and being a liaison between
                  the family and their medical needs is very important to her. With Brittany being
                  the first face you see when entering, she hopes her ample knowledge of Disney
                  princesses and dinosaurs will help your child feel at ease and excited to come
                  to Thrive! In her spare time, she enjoys traveling, reading, and spoiling her
                  niece and nephew. Brittany is excited to join the Thrive community and looks
                  forward to getting to know each and every one of you!
